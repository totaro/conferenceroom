# Conference Room Reservation App – Full Conversation Transcript

---

## User
I want to build conference room reservation web application.  
I will be using Antigravity to build out this app.  
I want to use some easy-to-understand and use Javascript based solution for this application.  
I need in-memory database with REST API to save data, recommend easy-to-use and free DB on that.  

The service must provide users with the following functionalities:

- Create a reservation: Reserve a room for a specific time period.
- Cancel a reservation: Delete a reservation.
- View reservations: List all reservations for a specific room.

Business logic (rules):

- Reservations must not overlap (two people cannot reserve the same room at the same time).
- Reservations cannot be made in the past.
- The start time must be before the end time.

I like this MVP that you give me. Can you give me a prompt based on this that I can use it with antigratity to build an app. Make it really basic and simple at first.
